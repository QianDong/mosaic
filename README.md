# photographic mosaic
A photographic mosaic is an image where the pixels (or rather small patches) have been replaced by tiny but complete images. 
In other words, the image is made out of other images. 
It is a cute idea and delightfully meta, so it is no wonder it is very popular on the internet. 
People have, for instance, created an image of a character from Harry Potter made out of frames from the movies

You probably need to change the data path accordingly.
